  "body": "## History\n\nOn 15 April 1861 Erhard Junghans created the company Junghans und Tobler together with his brother-in-law Jakob Zeller-Tobler in Schramberg.\n\nThe company began to produce wristwatches in 1927. Beginning in the 1950s, the Bauhaus designer Max Bill created clocks and watches for Junghans and the relationship lasted many years. A remarkable example of his work is a wall clock he designed in 1956–57 that is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art. In 1962 Bill also created mechanical wristwatches for Junghans. They were the official timekeeper for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.\n\n![Junhans Max Bill](https://res.cloudinary.com/lihbr/image/upload/v1556005600/bauhaus/junghans_watch_hg9tad.jpg \"Junhans Max Bill\")\n\nIn the late 1980s, Junghans introduced the first radio-controlled table clock on the world market. In 1990 the first radio-controlled wristwatch, called the MEGA 1, followed. In 1995 Junghans presented a solar-powered watch with ceramic housing. Together with the Japanese clock maker Seiko, Junghans developed a globally-oriented wristwatch that automatically sets the local time in respective time zones.\n\n## Junghans defence industry\n\nThe Junghans Microtec GmbH produces fuze-technology for artillery, mortar, medium-calibre, tanks, anti-tank and cruise missiles. Junghans Microtec is located in the small town of Dunningen-Seedorf close to Schramberg. The company produces fuses for 76 mm to 203 mm. The small German tank Wiesel AWC uses the Junghans fuse MFZ/M as a standard performance.\n\nIn December 2010 WikiLeaks posted documents from US anti-terror officials, which said that the production facilities of Junghans Microtec GmbH would be endangered by terrorist attacks."
